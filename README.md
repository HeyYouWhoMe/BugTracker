# BugTracker

We are excited to use GitHub as a Bug Tracker and here is the link that you can either add an issue, see issues in progress, and see issues that are closed.

# This is our Issues Link

Report bugs here!

# Please Help Us

As a small start-up, we can’t possibly test this app on a very wide range of phones, and although we will broaden our testing process to include a wider range of phones in proportion to the income we receive, we do rely on user feedback to drive our User Satisfaction process.

# If you don’t report it, we can’t prioritise it!

Until the Who™ Me Cloud comes online, we are tracking bugs using Github, at the following URL:

# Interacting

We have chosen Github because we anticipate that many developers will take advantage of using the Tappable URL Macro as an entry-point to their own portal, and by large, this is where developers hang out - hence, most developers already have their own Github login!

However if you have a bug to report and don’t have a login, please create one and add the bug, this way it will be visible to all users, as well as the progress of its resolution.

Heck, if you have an account here, you are more likely to create your own website that responds to our Tappable URL Macro links!

We definitely want to grow a developer community around us!
